## unstated-class-constructor-bug
A bug I found with `@gitbook/unstated` not working for Parcel.

```
Uncaught TypeError: Class constructor Container cannot be invoked without 'new'
```

### Running
Run the following, then open up `localhost:1234`. Check the console for errors.
```bash
npm start
```
