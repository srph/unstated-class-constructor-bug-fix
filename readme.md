## unstated-class-constructor-bug-fix
A fix I found with [`@gitbook/unstated`](https://github.com/GitbookIO/unstated/) [not working for Parcel (#1)](https://github.com/GitbookIO/unstated/issues/1).

See [PR](https://github.com/GitbookIO/unstated/pull/2) for more details.

### Running
Run the following, then open up `localhost:1234`. See to it that the console has no errors.
```bash
npm start
```
